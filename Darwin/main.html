            <div class="row darwin-info ml-3 mr-3 mt-4">
                Charles Darwin (1809 – 1882) was an English Natural scientist who laid down a framework for the theory of evolution – showing
                how Man evolved from lower life forms. At the time, his research and publication led to bitter controversy,
                but his theory of evolution and natural selection later became accepted within the scientific community.
